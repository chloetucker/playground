# playground
It's a place for me to play around with things that I learn and don't want to devote an entire project to. Each section is a self-contained experiment, a sandbox. 

## Project Development Process
This project pretty much came to mind more or less fully formed in its purpose. I just needed a place to play!

Practically, I knew I wanted to use Bootstrap, bright colors, animations, and have alternating boxes appear as the user scrolls down the page. I built this site in about two hours. (Design refinement took longer of course). 

## I Learned
- Front-end frameworks are a huge time-saver... I might never go back to not using them.
- Art comes in all forms - the loader was incredibly fun to make.

## Ideas to Improve
- Continue adding more sandboxes
